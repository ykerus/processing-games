This is an old project where I programmed some old-school games in Processing (Java). 
To play, simply open these files in Processing and run the program. 
A menu will let you navigate through the options.

The games included are Snake and Breakout. 
In the future I would like to improve the implementation of Breakout and add games that involve agents, such as Pacman.

Have fun!
